### Questions from People

- As comp sci major, are there any comp sci related courses that DCC has to offer?
	- 2nd and 3rd semester classes are smaller like Dr. Pfister mentioned and there were some coding classes offered both times
- 1/3 are comp sci majors
- Offer course taught by comp sci professor (programming languages & created their own???)
- Most gravitate towards less computer science

- Is everyone able to use the maker space or only DCC students?
	- Only DCC students
	- Nice lounge
	- Creative passions
	- Music is playing
	- Lighting is nice
	- Talk to people
	- 3D printing
	- Work on DCC projects (bottom of Prince Frederick)
	- Resource for personal project - send a request form!
	- Teach Me events (DCC staff & mentors)

- Is the capstone project completed in a team? If so, how large are the teams and how are teams formed?
	- Usually individual
		- More flexibility
	- Sometimes 2-3 people (especially events based)
		- May need different skillsets if project is huge

- Can you share some ways that DCC integrates new technologies with social, cultural, and economic values within class, activities (in and out of school), dedicated internships, etc?
	- Generative AI - implications (bias, environment, etc.)
- I was in that AI class and it was really cool! We got to learn the environmental effects like water use as well as ethical uses of AI (we looked at AI romantic chatbots gone wrong for example), we made a podcast by interviewing different professors on campus that integrate AI in their own work, we also got to make AI based projects at the end of the semesters (my group made a cooking show, AI recipe vs non-AI recipe), and so much more!!!
	- Express different designs that meets certain challenges

- Can you maybe explain the internship part of dcc
	- 300 level course related to design
	- Outside internship through UMD
	- Doesn't sponsor any

- Why did you three choose DCC over the other LLPs? Did you have experience with design, and if not, what was your experience in the program?
	- Aashika - DCC or nothing (art focus)
		- Community & people
		- Resources
		- Capstone!
		- Done art before in high school
	- Leah - DCC seems the most fun
		- Most other LLPs focused on specific topic
		- Passionate about art & thinking outside of the box
		- Wanted an outlet for creativity/holistic viewpoint
		- Compliment their major
		- Wide range of skills & topics
	- Saniya
		- Learning about human-centered design
		- Capstone!

- What are some AI related capstone projects that have been done (if any)? I’m mainly interested in generating AI systems for creative purposes in the humanities, and I’m interested if something similar like that has been done before.
	- Don't know!
	- Brandon Morson's AI computational systems
	- Terp AI (ChatGPT w/ guardrails)
