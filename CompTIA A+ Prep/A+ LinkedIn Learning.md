### Troubleshooting Theory

- Consider corporate policies, procedures & impacts before making changes

 1. Identify the problem
	 - Ask user what's wrong (environmental or infrastructure)
	 - May review system & application logs
2. Establish probable cause
	- Checking different systems
3. Test theory to determine cause
	- If theory isn't confirmed, reestablish new theory
	- Escalate issue, if necessary (call for help)
4. Establish plan of action to resolve problem & implement solution
5. Verify full system functionality/implement preventive measures
6. Documentation findings, actions & outcomes
	- Lessons learned - defining issues for future users w/ similar problems
