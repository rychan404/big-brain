### Troubleshooting Theory

- Consider corporate policies, procedures & impacts before making changes

 1. Identify the problem
	 - Ask user what's wrong (environmental or infrastructure)
	 - May review system & application logs
2. Establish probable cause
	- Checking different systems
3. Test theory to determine cause
	- If theory isn't confirmed, reestablish new theory
	- Escalate issue, if necessary (call for help)
4. Establish plan of action to resolve problem & implement solution
5. Verify full system functionality/implement preventive measures
6. Documentation findings, actions & outcomes
	- Lessons learned - defining issues for future users w/ similar problems

### What is a computer?

- Used to get stuff done
- Anything w/ CPU, RAM mass storage, & operating system
- CPUs
	- Brain of computer
- Programs 
	- Processor uses to manipulate peripherals & create files to get stuff done
- Mass storage
	- Where programs sit
	- Stores programs & data
	- M.2 SSD (Solid State Drive)
		- Hard drive
		- Stores data statically
	- CPU copies program onto RAM & runs program
	- Saving data copies from RAM to mass storage
- Operating systems
- Laptops, mobile devices & Internet of Things (IoT) are computers
	- Raspberry Pi
		- Tiny computer

## CPUs

### What is a CPU?

- Central Processing Unit
	- Powerful calculator that processes commands
- Machine language of CPU
	- Different binary patterns (0's & 1's) on code book represent different functions
- Registers
	- Storage areas w/ binary to perform computations
	- AX, BX, CX, DX, etc.
- Oldest CPU (Intel 8088 code)
- CPU clock
	- Tell CPU to do something
	- Requires it to be activated multiple times to zero out functions
- Pipeline/core
	- Different functions running simultaneously 
	- Optimize processing of commands
	- Ex: Prefetch sends different commands to specialized functions
		- Integer math
		- Long numbers
		- Cache (send to other places)

### Modern CPUs

- CPU capability based on clock speed & cores
- Clock speed
	- Measure speed through Hz (1 cycle per second)
		- Megahertz (MHz) = 1mil. cycles/second
		- Gigahertz (GHz) = 1 bil. cycles/second
- CPU cores
	- Multiple processors on 1 chip
	- Single-core
		- 1 connection where data can travel from CPU to RAM
	- Multi-core
		- Multiple connections where data can travel from CPU to RAM
	- Dual core
		- 2 connections where data can travel from CPU to RAM
	- Quad core
		- 4 connections where data can travel from CPU to RAM
- ARM chips
	- Cut back & simplified instructions (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)
	- High processing speed & reduced workload
- APU (Accelerated Processing Unit)
	- CPU & graphics card combined
	- Save space
- CPU-Z
	- Overview of hardware

### 32-Bit vs. 64 Bit Computing

- x86 (32 bit) & x64 (64 bit)
	- Amount of data CPU can handle at once
	- Can handle 2^32 or 2^64 bits of info

| Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) | Support 32-bit apps? | Support 64-bit apps? |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| x86                                | Yes                  | No                   |
| x86-64                             | Yes                  | Yes                  |
| x64 (x86-x64)                      | No                   | Yes                  |
- Intel Architecture, 32-bit (IA-32)
	- x86 based system
- x64 systems offer greater data handling, improved graphics performance & better security
